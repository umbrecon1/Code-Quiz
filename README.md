# Code-Quiz

This week's assignment was to make a multiple choice quiz!

When you click the start button, questions become present.
When you answer the question correct, you're presented with the next question.
When a question is answered incorrectly, your score and time will decrease.
The game is over when all questions are complete or the time hits 0.
Enter initials and save score upon completion.

This week we learned a lot about API's, so utilizing tools such as local storage, JSON, intervals, and manipulating the DOM we were able to accomplish this.
